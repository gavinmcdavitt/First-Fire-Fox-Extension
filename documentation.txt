manifest is a bunch of meta data that you need. If you need to specify an id go with:

"browser_specific_settings": {
  "gecko": {
    "id": "borderify@example.com"
  }
}
The first three keys: manifest_version, name, and version, are mandatory and contain basic metadata for the extension.
description is optional, but recommended: it's displayed in the Add-ons Manager.
icons is optional, but recommended: it allows you to specify an icon for the extension, that will be shown in the Add-ons Manager.
